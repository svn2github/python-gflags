==11 October 2010==

I've just released python-gflags 1.4.  This release has only minor
changes from 1.3, including support for printing flags of a specific
module, allowing key-flags to work with special flags, somewhat better
error messaging, and
[http://python-gflags.googlecode.com/svn/tags/python-gflags-1.4/ChangeLog so forth].
If 1.3 is working well for you, there's no particular reason to upgrade.

===4 January 2010===

I just released python-gflags 1.3. This is the first python-gflags
release; it is version 1.3 because this code is forked from the 1.3
release of google-gflags.

I don't have a tarball or .deb file up quite yet, so for now you will
have to get the source files by browsing under the 'source'
tag. Downloadable files will be available soon.
